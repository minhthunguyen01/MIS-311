## a. Data Description
The dataset titled "Cost of Living" provides an overview of the average monthly income and estimated cost of living across various countries and regions from 2000 to 2023.


The primary objective of this dataset is to understand and compare economic affordability across different countries and regions. By analyzing average monthly income alongside the cost of living, we can uncover how financially comfortable people are in various parts of the world.
